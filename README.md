## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- Dart SCSS
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow - Progressive Enhancement
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [RSCSS](https://rscss.io/) - For styles

### What I learned

Bootstrap has been very useful to set up the starting layout and after that, custom styles and measurements applied to the original design were needed to stick close enough it.

The semantic tags were wrapped inside div tags with `.row` and `.col` classes.

### Continued development

I would like to improve layout concepts and reinforce the use of semantic tags while using RSCSS system to style the components.
